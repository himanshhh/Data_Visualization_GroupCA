Vision\
The goal of the project is to analyze whether customers will subscribe to a term deposit with the bank or not. It is based on 3 main factors throughout the report:\
1. Demographic Characteristics: These characteristics consist of the personal details of the client including age, education, marital status, and job type.
2. Financial Characteristics: These attributes mainly encompass the financial conditions of the individual including their loan status (personal, default, or housing), and their bank balance.
3. Campaign Characteristics: These terms mainly include details from the current and previous campaigns conducted to market the term deposit idea to different individuals. \

Our goal is to understand the changes in purchase rate, i.e., the rate at which customers invest in the term deposit for the bank, based on these different characteristics, and find the key drivers that affect purchase rate, while also identifying high-value customers and how more customers can be convinced to invest with the bank. \
