## Dataset

The dataset is taken from the UCI Irvine machine learning repository ,dataset is about the phone campaigns with the individual customers of Portuguese banking services, Data is Multivariate, Business related and classification related problem. Data cleaning is done in python pandas library checked for missing values and Info of the dataset variables everything looks fine no missing values, identified unique categorical values in each variable this helps how we are going to deal with this data.

## Description of Excel

The data we have and going to lead with more categorical data end objective will a individual take term deposit Yes/No in the bank, many factors contribute to target variable like campaigns and job categories, marital status , average call duration with the each age categories using this features we are going to use the Excel based technology.


## Pivot tables & Charts brief understanding

Stacked bar chart(Job vs Deposit subscription) is taken to explain the count of the subscription based on the job categories This information is helpful to the banking organisation to make campaign decisions based on the job categories features taken inn the pivot table are the job variable to the row labels and the y output variable to the values label(count) column label is y variable itself. By this visualisation highest subscriptions are from the management job category but with the highest count of rejections.  
Clustered column chart(Age categories vs Deposit Subscription) This chart explains which age categories perform well to take the term deposit and the ratio of subscribed and not subscribed clearly here middle age categories not subscribed ratio is high it make slight unbalance, balanced group to target is the old age category it as the balanced no of no’s and yes for subscription.
Line chart(Month vs campaign success) with this chart we came to know that campaign success is with respect to month, in the month of may there are highest rejections to the subscriptions due to various reasons, in the month of Dec it has the highest no of subscriptions.
Donut chart(Total call duration by age categories) gives us information regarding average percent of duration of time sent with the different age categories Adults, and old people spent max time, one more Donut tells us total percent of the unsubscribed and subscribed.
Bar chart(Contact vs subscription) by visualization we can conclude that communication by cellular, telephone don’t make much difference. They are exactly the same conclusion communication medium don’t make impact on the subscription.
